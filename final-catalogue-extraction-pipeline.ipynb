    "        - **Year:** Extract the year of the exhibition.\n",
    "        - **Duration:** Extract for how long the exhibition is held in dd/mm-dd/mm format.\n",
    "        - **Type:** Identify whether it is a national or international exhibition\n",
    "        - **Institution:** Extract the name of the institution. (e.g. musis sacrum, pictura, arti et amicitiae)\n",
    "        - **Catalogue Price:** Extract the catalog price (e.g., ƒ0.25). Avoid entry prices.\n",

    "             If the exhibition is open on a given day, set \"true\".\n",

    "            If there are multiple membership prices, store an adjusted range that takes the cheapest price and the most expensive price.\n",
